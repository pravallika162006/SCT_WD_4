TASK 4:TO-DO WEB APPLICATION

🚀 Project Update - To-Do Web App 📝

As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology , I built a simple and user-friendly To-Do Web App that helps users:
✅ Add tasks with title, date & time
✏ Edit tasks instantly
📅 Organize daily goals
✔ Mark tasks as completed

🧠 This task helped me understand how even small tools, when built with clarity and purpose, can simplify everyday routines and improve time management.

I kept the design minimal and clear, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices.

🔧 Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
